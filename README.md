# Software Development Procedure

## Purpose
To define a standardized procedure for managing a software development project using agile methodology, ensuring high-quality deliverables and efficient project execution.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all software development projects within the organization.

## Procedure

### 1. Inputs
- **Funding**: Approved project budget.
- **High-level Milestones**: Major project milestones defined in the project charter.
- **Staffing**: Assigned project team members including developers, testers, and project managers.

### 2. Process

#### 2.1 Plan a Project Backlog

- **Objective**: Create and prioritize a list of project tasks (stories) to be completed.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Identify Requirements**:
      - Conduct stakeholder meetings to gather requirements.
      - Document requirements as user stories in the project management tool (e.g., Jira).
  2. **Prioritize Stories**:
      - Rank stories based on business value and effort estimation.
      - Use planning poker or T-shirt sizing for effort estimation.
  3. **Create Sprint Backlogs**:
      - Define sprint goals and select stories for the upcoming sprint.
  4. **Tools**:
      - Jira for backlog management.
      - Confluence for documentation.

#### 2.2 Execute the Project Backlog Using Agile Methodology

- **Objective**: Implement the project backlog iteratively.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Daily Stand-up Meetings**:
      - Conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, impediments, and plan for the day.
  2. **Sprint Planning**:
      - Hold sprint planning meetings at the start of each sprint to allocate tasks.
  3. **Sprint Review**:
      - Conduct sprint review meetings to demo completed stories to stakeholders.
  4. **Sprint Retrospective**:
      - Hold sprint retrospective meetings to discuss what went well and areas for improvement.
  5. **Tools**:
      - Slack or Microsoft Teams for communication.
      - Jira for sprint tracking.
      - Zoom or Teams for virtual meetings.

#### 2.3 Archive Design Documentation

- **Objective**: Preserve all design-related documents for future reference.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Document Storage**:
      - Store all design documents in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).
  2. **Access Control**:
      - Ensure only authorized personnel have access to design documents.
  3. **Retention Period**:
      - Archive design documents for a minimum of 5 years.
  4. **Tools**:
      - Confluence or SharePoint for document management.
      - Git for version control.

#### 2.4 Perform Design Reviews Before Implementation of Stories

- **Objective**: Ensure design meets quality standards and requirements before implementation.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Review Team**:
      - Minimum of 2 peer reviewers with relevant expertise.
  2. **Review Process**:
      - Conduct formal design reviews using a checklist.
      - Provide feedback and require approval before proceeding.
  3. **Tools**:
      - Review forms in Confluence.
      - Zoom or Teams for virtual review meetings.

#### 2.5 Perform Code Reviews Before Code is Merged to the Mainline

- **Objective**: Maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Review Team**:
      - Minimum of 2 peer reviewers.
  2. **Review Process**:
      - Use pull requests for code reviews.
      - Review code for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  3. **Approval Criteria**:
      - Code must pass all automated tests.
      - All review comments must be addressed.
  4. **Tools**:
      - GitHub or Bitbucket for pull requests.
      - Code review tools (e.g., Crucible).

#### 2.6 Archive and Perform a Test Plan to Ensure High Code Quality

- **Objective**: Validate that the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Test Plan Development**:
      - Develop a comprehensive test plan covering unit, integration, and system tests.
  2. **Test Execution**:
      - Execute tests and document results.
  3. **Defect Management**:
      - Track and manage defects using a defect tracking tool (e.g., Jira).
  4. **Archiving Test Results**:
      - Archive all test results and related documentation.
      - Retain test documentation for a minimum of 5 years.
  5. **Tools**:
      - Jenkins for CI/CD and test automation.
      - Jira for defect tracking.
      - Confluence for test documentation.

### 3. Outputs

- **Finished Software**: Delivered to the customer as per the project timeline.
- **Test Plan**: Documented and archived.
- **Design Documentation**: Documented and archived.

## Implementation Details

### 3.1 Agile Implementation

- **Scrum Framework**: Follow the Scrum framework with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team).
- **Sprint Duration**: Set sprint duration to 2 weeks.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**:
  - **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes impediments.
  - **Product Owner**: Manages product backlog, prioritizes stories.
  - **Development Team**: Delivers potentially shippable increments each sprint.
